# RAP_dataset_Tool

This script provides a way of converting RAP dataset to PASCAL VOC format, it is assumed that you have downloaded the dataset (from http://rap.idealtest.org/) and placed it in the same directory (i.e where you clone the repository)

After cloning the repository by downloading as zip, place the dataset in same folder, make a folder 'annotations' and from cmd run:
$python extr_ann.py  

this will create annotations in required format
